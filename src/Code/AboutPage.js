				<p>My Name is Chloe Martin; I am the owner and creator of Hard Lift. I have had a love for the fitness industry for 3 years now and have my Certificate 3 and 4 in Fitness. I decided to turn my love for fitness and helping people into a career to encourage women in particular become the best version of themselves. Self-empowerment is the greatest thing you can do for someone I believe and thatâ€™s why I am here to help people reach that goal. My core values include respectfulness, kindness, honesty, compassion and thoughtfulness.</p><br>

			</br><p>My vision is to create a community of women who are empowered and strong, working on becoming the best versions of themselves.</p><br>

		</br><p>I offer individual and small group personal training. I believe in the power of strength training, mindfulness and community to create positivity and personal growth. Having experienced self-esteem issues I can relate well with those who are feeling stuck and don't know where to start. </p><br>

	</br><p>I specialize in weight loss, muscle building, body sculpting, mindset training, and functional training.</p>
